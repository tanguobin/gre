        <p>To use the calculator, click the calculator icon at the top of the screen. To dismiss the calculator, click the icon again. To move the calculator to another place on the screen, click its title bar and drag it.</p>
        <p>To operate the calculator, click the calculator buttons or use the keyboard or keypad numbers and operations. To use the keypad, the NumLock key must be on.</p>
        <p><span class="help-calculator-img"></span></p>
        <p>The calculator display 8 digits and works like a typical basic calculator except that it respects order of operations, where, in a computation involving more that one operation, multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. For example, if 1 + 2 * 4 = is entered, the result will be 9, not 12, because the multiplication will be performed before the addition.</p>
        <p>The calculator has a memory location for storing a number, which is initially 0. To add the displayed number to the stored number, click the M+ button. An <b>M</b> will appear next to the display to show that a new number has been stored. To recall the stored number, click the MR button. To clear the memory, click the MC button, which resets the memory to 0, removing the <b>M</b>.</p>
        <p>There is an extra button called Transfer Display, which you can use on Numeric Entry questions with a single answer box. Clicking the Transfer Display button will transfer the calculator display to the answer box. You should check that the transfered number has the correct form to answer the question. For example, if a question requires you to round your answer or convert it to a percent, make sure that you adjust the transfered number accordingly.</p>
