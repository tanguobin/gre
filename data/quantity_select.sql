There are 580 ways of selecting a first member who is not a lawyer and 579 ways of selecting a second member who is not a lawyer. Multiplying these two numbers gives the number of ways to select two members who are not lawyers. However, in the (580)(579) ways, each group of 2 members who are not lawyers is counted twice. You can see this by considering two members, A and B. The two members can be chosen in 2 ways: A first, followed by B, and B first, followed by A. To adjust for double counting, you need to divide (580)(579) by 2.Similarly, the number of ways 2 members can be selected from among the 700 members is (700)(699) divided by 2. Thus, the desired probability is<br/>((580)(579)/2)/((700)(699)/2) = (580)(579)/(700)(699)<br/>Since the answer choices are all tenths, you need to approximate the value of this fraction to the nearest tenth. There are several ways to do this approximation. One way is to use your calculator to convert the fraction to a decimal and round the decimal to the nearest tenth. Another way is to approximate the value of the fraction as follows.<br/>(580)(579)/(700)(699) ≈ (600)(600)/(700)(700) = (6/7)² = 36/49 ≈ 36/50 = 0.72<br/>Either way, the answer choice that is closest to the value of the fraction is 0.7. The correct answer is Choice C.Another approach to this problem is to consider the random selections as two separate but successive events. The probability of selecting a first member who is not a lawyer is 580/700, because there are 580 members out of the 700 members who are not lawyers. For the second selection, there are only 699 members left to select from, because one member has already been selected. If the first member selected is not a lawyer, then there are only 579 members left who are not lawyers. So the probability of selecting a second member who is not a lawyer, given the condition that the first member selected was not a lawyer, is 579/699. The probability that both members selected will not be lawyers is the product of the two probabilities, or (580/700)(579/699), which is approximated above as 0.72.

This suggests drawing two triangles, one in which the angle between the two sides is close to 0 degrees and one in which the angle between the two sides is close to 180 degrees. In the triangle in which the angle between the sides of length 5 and 9 is small, you can see that the length of the third side is a bit greater than 9 – 5, or 4.

It is a good idea to look at the graphs before you try to answer the questions, so you can become familiar with the information contained in the graphs. Then, as you read each question, you should think about which of the graphs contains the information you need to solve the problem. It could be that all the information you need to solve the problem is contained in one of the graphs, or it could be that you need to get information from both of the graphs. The graph on the left shows the relationship between the speed of the automobile and the distance it traveled during the reaction time. Therefore, the answer to this question is found using this graph by reading the speed, in miles per hour, corresponding to a distance of 52 feet. A distance of 52 feet is a little above the distance of 50 feet on the vertical axis of the graph. On the graph, the speed corresponding to a distance of 52 feet is a little less than 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is Choice B.', 'hard');

Since 45 + 88 = 133, the correct answer is Choice A.', 'hard');
