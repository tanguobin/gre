The work contains some pioneering ideas, but apparently it is not overall a pioneering work. Thus the two words that could fill the blank appropriately are “original” and “innovative.” Note that “orthodox” and “conventional” are two words that are very similar in meaning, but neither one completes the sentence sensibly.

Among the answer choices, “intransigent” and “resolute,” although not strictly synonymous, both fit the logic of the description given here for completing the blank and create sentences that are similar in meaning. “Lax” and “negligent” are clearly similar in meaning and would create sentences similar in meaning, but they continue the sentiment voiced in the initial clause rather than contrasting with it. “Deferential” and “obsequious” are also similar in meaning, but their emphasis on “politeness,” while not strictly synonymous with reluctance and circumspection, like “lax” and “negligent” fail to pick up on the expected contrast. Thus the correct answer is intransigent (Choice B) and resolute (Choice F).', 'easy');

However, the phrase “without necessary relation to what had gone before” is presented as an elaboration on the word in the blank.

From the six words offered as answer choices, the pair “antedated” and “preceded” and the pair “portrayed” and “represented” each produce sentences that are similar in meaning. However, only “antedated” and “preceded” make sense in the context of the sentence: Rainer’s 1974 film exhibits feminist themes in a limited way because it came before she became active in feminist politics. Thus the correct answer is antedated (Choice A) and preceded (Choice D).', 'easy');

Though “adjust” makes some sense when inserted into the blank, no other option produces a sentence similar in meaning.

The only words that do so are “undiminished” and “undamaged” (Choices B and D), which produce sentences alike in meaning. “Undecided” and “unresolved” also produce sentences alike in meaning, but neither word makes sense when inserted into the blank.

Therefore, the words that fill the blank should describe a reaction to results that are better than hoped for, and the choices “thrilled about” and “elated by” both express such a reaction. The scientists may well also have been eager for, or keen on, the information, but their eagerness is not well explained by the unexpectedness of the information.

Since he is described as a “demanding reader,” the words that best fit the blank will be similar in meaning to “demanding.” The words that meet this requirement are “exacting” (Choice A) and “meticulous” (Choice F), and they produce sentences that are alike in meaning. Although “acerbic analyses” means close to the same thing as “scathing analyses,” both “acerbic” and “scathing” have meanings that are quite different from “demanding,” so neither fits well in the blank.

So for the sentence to make sense, the word filling the blank has to be something that is consistent with generosity and yet might, by those without a full understanding of her behavior, be mistaken for miserliness. The words “frugality” and “thrift” fulfill this requirement and yield two sentences that are alike in meaning, so that pair forms the correct answer. Neither “stinginess” nor “illiberality” makes sense in the sentence, since they are synonymous with “miserliness” and inconsistent with generosity. Other choices, such as “diffidence,” might perhaps make a sensible sentence if placed in the blank but do not form part of the correct answer since they have no companion word that would make a sentence of similar meaning.

A lack of agreement on the assumptions that underlie Congress members’ policy objectives would contribute to such a difficulty. Accordingly, “disparate” and “divergent” are the best choices because they both indicate disagreement among the members. Although the words “trite” and “trivial” are similar in meaning, triteness and triviality do not help to explain the difficulty in developing a consensus.

In their own way, Choices A, C, D, and F are consistent with that idea, but only two of these when taken together — “restive” and “skittish” — produce sentences that are alike in meaning. “Aloof” fits the blank reasonably well, but there is no other word offered that is nearly alike in meaning.

The words “limited” and “circumscribed” do so and also produce sentences that are alike in meaning, so this pair forms the correct answer. Although “undiscovered” and “hidden” are similar in meaning, they do not make sense in the context of the sentence, since they do not indicate why the painter’s talents were not adequate. Other choices, such as “partial” and “prosaic” might make sense in context, but none of the other choices that meets that criterion also has a companion choice that would produce another sentence alike in meaning.

Of these words, only “innocuous” and “benign” produce sentences with the same meaning.

But those two sentences would be internally contradictory, suggesting that doing something unwise would completely solve a problem. “Fleeting” and “momentary” suggest that the event referred to (“a fresh infusion of cash”) might have some beneficial effect, but that it would ultimately not resolve the problem.
